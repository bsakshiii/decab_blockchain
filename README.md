# Decab: Decentralized Ride-hailing System using Blockchain Technology

This project presents a decentralized ride-hailing system built on blockchain technology, using Ethereum's smart contracts to facilitate transparent, secure, and cost-effective cab bookings. It eliminates the need for a central authority, offering users privacy and reduced transaction fees.

## Features

- **Decentralized System**: Removes intermediaries to reduce costs and increase privacy.
- **Blockchain-Powered**: Utilizes Ethereum for immutable and secure transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates ride booking, payments, and driver registration.
- **Cryptocurrency Payments**: Supports Ether payments through MetaMask.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Enables location-based ride management.
- **Transparency and Trust**: All transactions recorded on the blockchain, ensuring accountability.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Development Tools**: Truffle, Ganache
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Payment Gateway**: MetaMask
- **Location Services**: Google Maps API

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Decab.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Decab
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start Ganache:
   ```bash
   ganache-cli
   ```
5. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --reset
   ```
6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Ensure MetaMask is installed in your browser and connected to the Ethereum network.
- Use the app to register as a user or driver.
- Book rides based on source and destination locations.
- Complete the ride and process payments using MetaMask.

## Future Scope

- **Mobile Application**: Develop a dedicated mobile app for better accessibility.
- **Mainnet Deployment**: Transition from test networks to the Ethereum mainnet.
- **Scalability**: Address blockchain scalability issues for broader adoption.
